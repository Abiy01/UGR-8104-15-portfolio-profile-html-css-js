                    <p>Hi, I’m Abiy, a 20-year-old video editor and thumbnail designer from Ethiopia. Currently, I’m pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology, where I’m combining my passion for technology with my creative skills. My work is driven by a love for creativity and innovation, and I strive to create visuals that resonate with audiences.

                        Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from editing dynamic videos to designing eye-catching thumbnails that capture viewers’ attention. Through these experiences, I’ve honed my skills in tools like Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and After Effects, and developed a keen understanding of visual storytelling and audience engagement.
                        
                        As a software engineering student, I bring a unique perspective to my projects by integrating technical problem-solving with artistic expression. I enjoy finding efficient workflows, automating repetitive tasks, and exploring how emerging technologies like AI can enhance creativity in media production.
                        
                        Beyond my technical and creative work, I am deeply committed to continuous learning and personal growth. I’m passionate about leveraging my skills to create meaningful content that not only entertains but also inspires and educates others.
                        
                        In the future, I aim to expand my expertise in areas like UX/UI design, motion graphics, and interactive media, while exploring how technology can bridge the gap between art and innovation. I believe that storytelling and design have the power to make a difference, and I aspire to use my talents to contribute to impactful projects both locally and globally. </p>
